# Welcome to learn JavaScript
# Introduction
- console :
  - Nơi in ra lỗi
  - Trong java script thì console là 1 từ khoá đặc biệt, đã được xây dựng sẵn
- comment :
  - As we write JavaScript, we can write comments in our code that the computer will ignore as our program runs. These comments exist just for human readers
  - two types : single line comment,multi-line comment
- Data Types:
  - Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, Object
- Arithmetic Operators :
  - +, -, *, /, % (remainder)
  - What is the difference between printing `3 + 4` and `’3 + 4’`?
- String Concatenation
- Properties vs Methods:
  - .toUpperCase(), .trim()
- Built-in Objects in JavaScript
- Variable : You can think of variables as little containers for information that live in a computer’s memory. Information stored in variables, such as a username, account number, or even personalized greeting can then be found in memory .It is important to distinguish that variables are not values; they contain values and represent them with a name
  - Variables are stored in memory.
  - rules for naming variables:
    - Variable names cannot start with numbers
    - are case sensitive, so myName and myname would be different variables.
    - cannot be the same as keywords
  - Var
  - Let :
    - declare a variable without assigning the variable a value In such a case, the variable will be automatically initialized with a value of undefined
  - Create a Variable: const:
    - a const variable cannot be reassigned because it is constant. If you try to reassign a const variable, you’ll get a TypeError
  - Mathematical Assignment Operators:
  - The Increment and Decrement Operator: ++, --
  - String Concatenation with Variables:
  - String Interpolation

# Conditionals :
  - if, else if, and else statements :
    - If
    - Else
    - Else If Statements:
      - 
  - comparison operators: >, <, <= , >=, ===, !==
    - Whats the different between two (`==`) and three (`===`) equal signs? 3 equals signs is known as Identity / strict equality, meaning that the data types also must be equal:
  - logical operators: &&, ||, !
  - truthy vs falsy values :
    - falsy: 0, "", '', null, undefined, NaN
  - ternary operators
  - switch statement :
    - Giống if else nhưng dễ đọc hơn
